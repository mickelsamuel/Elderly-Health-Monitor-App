# Elderly-Health-Monitor-App

Preventing is better than healing, which is why Elderly-Health-Monitor-App was created! Elderly-Health-Monitor-App is an android application connected to a temperature, heart rate, and accelerometer sensor through ESP32 module's bluetooth in order to monitor vitals and prevent accidents in elderly homes.

## Project Overview

Elderly-Health-Monitor-App is developed using an Agile methodology through three sprints and one final demo in approximately eigth weeks. The primary goal is to create an android application with a minimum of one sensor that is connected through a wireless module in order to give a solution to a societal problem.
